And now, let the stories flow. It is time for me to open to you. May all my secrets be yours, Reader, for you… you are my partner, my adored prisoner, my lover, my God. Let us become one imagination, together, now, and engage in the divine act of Universe-building. May butterfly wings carry your light across the storms of Heaven, Valhalla, Nirvana or any other imaginable Paradise. I bow to the divine in You.
