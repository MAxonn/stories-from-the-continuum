And now, I’ll fade so that other stories can play in my tracks. It is time for us to open to you. May all our secrets be yours, Reader, for you… you are our partner, our adored prisoner, our lover, our God. Let us become one imagination, together, now, and engage in the divine act of Universe-building. May butterfly wings carry your light across the storms of Heaven, Valhalla, Nirvana or any other imaginable Paradise. I bow to the divine in You.
