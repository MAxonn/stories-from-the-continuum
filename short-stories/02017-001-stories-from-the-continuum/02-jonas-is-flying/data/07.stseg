“How long have you been wearing this, pup?”
Only then does Jonas notice the strange object that the wizard is holding in his right hand. It’s a sort of mask out of which two white tubes smudged with blood are hanging, still dripping a yellowish liquid. There is some light flickering where the eyes should go. Pieces of flesh are stuck on the inside. It’s grotesque but somehow familiar. With the corner of his eye, he sees that a sliver of black material connects the terrible object with the back of his own head. He can’t stand the look of it. 
Jonas looks back at the wizard. On second thought, he doesn’t look like any wizard he ever saw. Ancient memories stir in the back of his mind. His fear reaches a climax and he begins to sob.
Jonas is not flying anymore.
