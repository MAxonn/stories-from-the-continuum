Jonas is drowning. He kicks and threshes into his tank. At last, he manages to rip the virtual reality headset from his face, along with the oxygen tube. He can’t see anything. There must’ve been a power outage, but his tank was equipped with a redundant backup system. His feeble legs kick the tank’s window, but after the months he’s been spending here, he could hardly have the power to walk down a flight of stairs.
His muscles cramp, he tries to scream but the water won’t let him. Horror crumples his sanity. Suddenly, the light opens in the room outside. Frenetically, he starts searching his VR helmet. But then he sees something moving. Under his dying gaze, two masked men are hauling his backup generators towards the exit in a rusty cart, along with his top of the line entertainment system.
He kicks one more time, with all his might. This time, the window breaks and a bit of water starts trickling outside. One of the masked men stops and produces a flashlight. He looks inside and panics when he sees the submerged victim. He starts screaming something that Jonas can’t understand and runs away along with his companion.
Jonas is not flying anymore.
