Jonas is flying. Across the lands below autumn is on parade. A myriad warm colors spill from hill to hill, right up to the feet of the nearby mountains. There aren’t many farms out here, but the few fields he does see have already been emptied of their crop. Winter is not far at all. It is already turning mountain peaks into white fangs that pierce the darkening sky. Strong currents of cold air coming from there often force him to check his compass and adjust course.
Any delay would mean certain doom. There is a battle to be fought and Jonas intends to turn the tide of what has so far been a disastrous campaign. It’s not often that an air strike is affordable, but they’ve been losing ground for months. This is their last chance to secure important land before winter will slow the war down to a grueling crawl.
He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to better shield his eyes from the frigid air through which he and his companions are rushing. Despite the mounting pressure brought by the importance of their mission, Jonas is ecstatic. Every now and then, he takes a puff from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke from his nostrils as he looks up, grinning towards the skies.
He can sometimes hear the war chants from behind him. They have trained hard for this day. Now, in the few hours they have until they reach the battleground, his friends have time for a little fun. They’re strapped in their places down below where speed of their flight is less harmful for human interaction. 
The smell of dry leaves makes its way to them as they fly over the rusty forest covering a tall hilltop. Among the trees, a thin brown line can sometimes be seen. They’re close enough for Jonas’ sharp eyes to spot a loaded carriage making its way along the road. It’s pulled by an ox, so he assumes these must be some rich farmers trying to move some of their crop behind the walls of the nearest castle. The villages in these border areas have been warned that the enemy has crossed the great river in the west. A difficult winter is heading their way. But Jonas means to change all that. He finds himself wondering how history will remember this day.
