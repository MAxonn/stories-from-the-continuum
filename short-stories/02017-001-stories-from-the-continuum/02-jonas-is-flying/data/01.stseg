Jonas is flying. Across the lands below autumn is on parade. A myriad warm colors spill from hill to hill, right up to the feet of the nearby mountains. There aren’t many farms out here, but the few fields he does see have already been emptied of their crops. Winter is not far at all. It is already turning mountainpeaks into white fangs that pierce the darkening sky. Strong currents of cold air coming from there often force him to check his compass and adjust course.
Any delay would mean certain doom. There is a battle to be fought and Jonas intends to turn the tide of what has so far been a disastrous campaign. It’s not often that an air strike is affordable, but they’ve been losing ground for months. This is their last chance to secure important land before winter will slow the war down to a grueling crawl.
He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to properly shield his eyes from the frigid air through which he and his companions are rushing. Despite the stakes, Jonas is ecstatic. Every now and then, he takes a puff from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke column from his nostrils as he’s grinning towards the skies.
He can sometimes hear the war chants from behind him. They have trained hard for this day. Now, in the few hours they have until they reach the battleground, his friends have time for a bit of fun. They’re strapped in their places down below where speed of their flight is slightly less harmful for human interaction. He finds himself wondering how this day will go down in history. 
The smell of dry leaves makes its way to them as they fly over the rusty forests covering a tall hill. They’re close enough for Jonas’ sharp eyes to spot a loaded carriage making its way along a road. It’s pulled by an ox, so he assumes these must be some rich farmers trying to move some of their crop into the castle walls before the arrival of what was already rumored to be a turbulent winter.
In his hands, the metal rod that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic. Now and then, he has to change the position of his hands, warming up another part of the cold rod.
He takes another puff from his fire-bag and closes his eyes for a bit. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. He feels the dragon’s kick in his spine as the creature’s mighty wings push them towards their destiny. Then he feels the rod tilt to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. He immediately opens his eyes. There is somebody else’s hand on the rod and he reflexively grabs it before even looking to his right. The feeling of warm, exposed skin, wakes him up to the impossibility of the situation: at this height, at this speed, there is no warm skin.
