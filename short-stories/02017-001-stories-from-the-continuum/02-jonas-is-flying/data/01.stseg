Jonas is flying. The autumn is at its most colorful in the lands below and the peaks of the Barrier Mountains are already covered in snow. He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to properly shield his eyes from the air through which he and his companions are rushing. Every now and then, he takes a puff from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke column from his nostrils as he’s grinning towards the skies.
Now and then, he can hear the war chants from behind him. They have trained hard for this day, but in the few hours they have until they reach The Battleground, his friends have time for a bit of fun. They’re strapped in their places a bit further back and below, where speed of their flight is slightly less harmful for human interaction.
A smell of leaves makes its way through his nostrils as they fly over the rusty autumn forests covering the northern hills. In his hands, the metal rod that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic. Now and then, he has to change the position of his hands, warming up another part of the cold rod.
He takes another puff from his fire-bag and closes his eyes for a bit. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. He feels the dragon’s kick in his spine as the creature’s mighty wings push them towards their destiny. Then he feels the rod tilt to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. He immediately opens his eyes. There is somebody else’s hand on the rod and he reflexively grabs it before even looking to his right. The feeling of warm, exposed skin, wakes him up to the impossibility of the situation: at this height, at this speed, there is no warm skin.
