In his hands, the metal rod that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic. Now and then, he has to change the position of his hands, warming up another part of the cold rod.
He takes another puff from his fire-bag and closes his eyes for a bit. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. He feels the dragon’s kick in his spine as the creature’s mighty wings push them towards their destiny. Then he feels the rod tilt to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. He immediately opens his eyes. There is somebody else’s hand on the rod and he reflexively grabs it before even looking to his right. The feeling of warm, exposed skin, wakes him up to the impossibility of the situation: at this height, at this speed, there is no warm skin.
She looks right through him, expressing wrathful patience. Her blue eyes beg him to keep hold of her hand, but the diamond crown on her head punishes his transgression. Jonas immediately lets go.
“Majesty! You should not be here!” he screams, trying to make himself heard in spite of the torrents of air. But as soon as she opens her mouth to speak, a translucent sphere engulfs them and an almost holy silence surrounds them. Jonas, like any of the Majesty’s Dragon Knights, is aware that the princess is an adept spell caster. Yet, his pilot instincts scream against the violation of the rules of nature. Below, the ground moves at dizzying speed and above, they’re sitting in a bubble of calmness where even a stray green dragonfly has found refuge.
“I go and observe where I please,” she answers back in the sweetest voice. With a gracious index finger, she draws a rectangle in front of them, and a mirror materializes out of thin air. Strange symbols and runes appear on its surface and Jonas can easily make out the enemy dragons approaching The Battleground. With this information, he might easily win the contest.
“Why did you show me this?” he asks, unbelieving.
“Because I want you to come back alive.”
Before he can reply, she leans over and kisses him on the lips, imparting such a jolt of energy that he can barely withstand. He feels like he might faint, but then the air blasts him again and the princess is gone. The dragon continues on the new course. In just half an hour they will attack the enemy dragons from behind, and he will arrive back at the castle as the Champion.
