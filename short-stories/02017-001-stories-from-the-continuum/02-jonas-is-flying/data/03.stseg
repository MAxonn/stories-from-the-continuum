With his fire-bag now empty, Jonas prepares for battle. He’d been smoking potent Indica, so now his mind is rushing and floating over tactical calculations as he anticipates the trajectory of the three enemy black dragons. He pulls the citrus spray from his belt and squeezes it hard towards his friends. On cue, they prepare their bows and light up the fireballs on top of their staves.
As the first fire ball gloriously hits the last enemy dragon, Jonas feels water flowing on his face. A large portion of the sky becomes black and starts to flicker with menacing red colors.
“What the…” he manages, before a mountain shows up in front of them. They fly through it, into darkness, while in the same time blue and yellow stripes dance around him. They look just like the stripes on his hat. He looks back. His men are gone, so is the dragon. His entire body starts hurting, then convulsing. And suddenly, he’s falling. He draws a panicky breath, but instead of air, he draws water.
