Jonas Is Flying 
</H1>
<P>
﻿1
</P>
<P>
Jonas is flying. Across the lands below autumn is on parade. A myriad warm colors spill from hill to hill, right up to the feet of the nearby mountains. There aren’t many farms out here, but the few fields he does see have already been emptied of their crop. Winter is not far at all. It is already turning mountain peaks into white fangs that pierce the darkening sky. Strong currents of cold air coming from there often force him to check his compass and adjust course.
</P>
<P>
Any delay would mean certain doom. There is a battle to be fought and Jonas intends to turn the tide of what has so far been a disastrous campaign. It’s not often that an air strike is affordable, but they’ve been losing ground for months. This is their last chance to secure important land before winter will slow the war down to a grueling crawl.
</P>
<P>
He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to better shield his eyes from the frigid air through which he and his companions are rushing. Despite the mounting pressure brought by the importance of their mission, Jonas is ecstatic. Every now and then, he takes a puff from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke from his nostrils as he looks up, grinning towards the skies.
</P>
<P>
He can sometimes hear the war chants from behind him. They have trained hard for this day. Now, in the few hours they have until they reach the battleground, his friends have time for a little fun. They’re strapped in their places down below where speed of their flight is less harmful for human interaction.
</P>
<P>
The smell of dry leaves makes its way to them as they fly over the rusty forest covering a tall hilltop. Among the trees, a thin brown line can sometimes be seen. They’re close enough for Jonas’ sharp eyes to spot a loaded carriage making its way along the road. It’s pulled by an ox, so he assumes these must be some rich farmers trying to move some of their crop behind the walls of the nearest castle. The villages in these border areas have been warned that the enemy has crossed the great river in the west. A difficult winter is heading their way. But Jonas means to change all that. He finds himself wondering how history will remember this day.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The elevator’s doors slam shut with a soft thump leaving its occupants in complete darkness. There’s barely enough space for the two men inside to huddle together, crouching and kneeling, with the back of their necks pressed firmly against the metal ceiling. It wasn’t meant to transport humans or any living thing for that matter. They wait for the elevator to start moving. Nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
This has not been a good night. They almost got caught when they broke into the building. A proximity sensor hadn’t been listed on their map. After tripping the alarm they went hiding behind the first door they could open. It was a mix of luck and incompetence that saved them. The soldiers patrolling the ground floor didn’t bother to check their own locker room.
</P>
<P>
In this country, the punishment for meddling in the military’s affairs is worse than death. A mysterious employer and the guarantee of a fat payday had made the risk seem worth it. But now the unbearable delay makes the two men reconsider their choices. Within seconds, the metal box turns into an inspiration for their worst nightmares. The silence is suffocating. Cold sweat. Racing hearts. Frozen thought.
</P>
<P>
With a subtle jolt, their prison starts its descent. One of the men lets out a sigh of relief. He shuffles, trying to shift his weight from his aching knees. His partner is tense like a bow’s string and unmoving like a rock. The smell of sewage they felt when entering the building is getting worse. It doesn’t help them to think that the elevator’s destination is about thirty meters below street level.
</P>
<P>
“I sure hope we don’t splash into anything”, says a trembling, weary voice.
</P>
<P>
“Shut up old man”, comes the stiff answer. They don’t know each other’s real name, having met less than an hour ago on a nearby street. It was enough time to realize they’ll get along like water and oil.
</P>
<P>
“Relax Ed”, says a voice in both their ears. “Nobody bothers eavesdrop this grave”. It’s Glitch, the man or woman who supervises this heist. They use “he”, but it’s hard to know because the voice is passed through a cheap filter that makes it sound like an action movie robot from the early twenties.
</P>
<P>
It’s getting hot. Silence swallows their words and breaths. Ed realizes that keeping his mouth shut isn’t that easy after all. Why is it so quiet? Does this damned elevator even have a motor? Is it still moving? Bothered by doubt his mind calls upon imagination to discourage the current course of action. Imagination obliges. He sees himself facing sentencing after a summary trial. His wife is there, crying. No, wait, that’s ridiculous. He sees himself on the operating table, no trial at all. His wife has already been converted.
</P>
<P>
“Why couldn’t you fix us a normal elevator Glitch? You’re supposed to own this entire building now, aren’t you?” asks Ed. His imagination pouts. It doesn’t like interruptions.
</P>
<P>
“Because controlling a building is not as easy as hacking a delivery truck and making it drive me around the neighborhood. And because there aren’t any normal elevators here.” Then, after a short pause Glitch treats them to one of his sadistic jokes: “These guys don’t get out much”. Cue the annoying robotic laughter.
</P>
<P>
“How large is the unit?” asks the old man.
</P>
<P>
“Large enough for one of you to stay behind and contemplate betrayal by the others and imagine a life of serving the Watchers.” That laughter again, same intonation, same length, he’s probably using a sample.
</P>
<P>
“This’ll be one case when age won’t come before beauty”, sneers Ed. The other man ignores him. It’s the worst possible answer.
</P>
<P>
Without any warning, the doors open. Ed almost lets out a scream. He keeps quiet, but the old man chuckles. He must’ve felt him tense up. Ed wants to ask him how long has it been since they stopped but his pride is stronger than his curiosity.
</P>
<P>
The old man turns on the flashlight on his shoulder. A gray corridor extends for as far as they can see. The flashlight increases its output as their eyes adjust to the bright light. The corridor is not much taller than the elevator but at least it’s wider. They crawl out and stretch on the floor in the only direction they can.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is lined with metal hatches on both sides. Less than two meters separate each hatch. This place is very crowded. Ed turns on his own light. Not even two fully powered directional flashlights can help them see the end of the corridor. There must be hundreds if not thousands of rooms on this level alone.
</P>
<P>
He notices that the builders haven’t even bothered to install light sources in this place. These walls had never seen the light of day, he realizes. A chill tiptoes down his spine, beckoning his imagination to come out and play. Imagination obliges. They’re going to get trapped here. No, that’s ridiculous. They’re going to live here. Or at least he is. The old man will probably get out with the loot and together with Glitch he’s going to laugh all the way to the Corporation or to whatever shady institution would be willing to pay top credit for the tech they’re about to steal.
</P>
<P>
﻿3
</P>
<P>
It’s dark now. A farmer and his two helpers have just finished repairing their carriage. They are rushing along a forest road [?], eager to get back to the safety of the village. Grunting as they pull the overloaded thing, nobody heeds the trees stirring behind them. A single torch is fighting a losing battle against the darkness. Swarms of shadows squirm all around the path. Then they hear a strange sound coming from behind them. It’s almost like a breath, the breath of something very large.
</P>
<P>
“What was that?” asks one of the helpers.
</P>
<P>
The farmer turns to answer but before he can open his mouth, he’s slapped by a gust of unnatural wind. Above them, the trees protest, showering them with dead leaves and broken twigs. Their torch is extinguished in an instant, leaving a trail of glowing red tears swirling around them. Then, the only light is that of the stars above. They look there, almost expecting something to happen. Another blast of wind as a black shape crosses the starry landscape. Trapped inside their own bodies, locked by an overriding survival instinct, the farmers wait for the creatures to pass praying that none of them stops for an easy snack.
</P>
<P>
But Jonas and his squad have more pressing matters to attend to. He had noticed the peasants’ torch from many miles away. On another day he might have avoided flying above them, but now he cannot afford even the slightest change in course. In his hands, the metal rod that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic.
</P>
<P>
They are close now. Up ahead, far away, the battle is in full swing. Sometimes, green lighting flashes behind the smoke that rises from the battleground. The enemy warlocks had entered the fray as soon as the sun set. No purple lightning so far, which means that their own wizards are probably bidding their time until the air support arrives. He just hopes the infantry doesn’t get wiped out until then.
</P>
<P>
He takes another puff from his fire-bag. The wave of focus and relaxation is just about perfect, but not quite there. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. Eyes closed, he clutches the steering rod knowing that another river of cold mountain air lies in front of them. Jonas is one with the wind now. In his mind, he sees the great mountains shape the air across the land. He feels the dragon’s mighty push through his every vertebrae as the creature’s huge wings push them towards their destiny.
</P>
<P>
Then, against all his strength, he feels the steering rod tilt to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. There is somebody else’s hand on the rod. He grabs it even before opening his eyes in anger and surprise. There’s only room for a single pilot underneath the dragon’s scaled throat. But the one that has taken over his creature is not sitting next to Jonas, but rather floating in the air just in front of him.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a shimmering blue sphere is the last person he expected to see today. She looks straight into his soul, expressing wrathful patience. Her blue eyes beg him to keep hold of her hand, but the diamond crown on her head punishes his transgression. Jonas immediately lets go. He throws his hands to his sides, in unconditioned surrender. They’ve been discovered. The mission is over.
</P>
<P>
“Majesty…” he manages to whisper, knowing that his word will be smothered by the torrents of air as soon as it leaves his lips.
</P>
<P>
With a gracious wave of her hand, she extends her magical shield around him. Inside the holy silence, his own heartbeat terrifies him. She’s going to crash them into the ground. Or worse, she’s going to turn him against his own people.
</P>
<P>
“Hello Jonas”, she says. Her voice makes his hair stand. Despite its innocence, there is power beyond human understanding in her every syllable.
</P>
<P>
Jonas can’t dare look behind, but he hopes that the rest of the squad has not been tricked into following the new direction. Dragons are immune to most spells, but not their pilots. What if she’s not alone? There are certain measures that can be taken against spell-casters. Jonas is well trained in them. But in front of him is no usual caster. Covered in a simple white and silver robe is the Ivory Princess herself.
</P>
<P>
He’s too scared to think what to do next so he just sits there with his hands still at his sides, having relinquished complete control of his dragon. The woman smiles at him. He sinks inside her dark eyes.
</P>
<P>
“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to hurt you.”
</P>
<P>
The dragon continues its flight unabated. His pilot instincts scream against the violation of the rules of nature. Below, the ground moves at dizzying speed and above, not a single lock of her blonde hair moves. They’re sitting in a bubble of calmness where even a stray, green firefly has found refuge.
</P>
<P>
With slow movements, the Princess draws a rectangle in the space between them. He watches her index finger scar the air with its sharp whiteness. She’s drawing a map. On it, with her other fingers, she leaves several colored marks.
</P>
<P>
“That’s where the warlocks are”, she says while placing more marks on the map. “And that’s where the griffons are. They’ll be expecting you to attack the warlocks from the north. But they’re in for a surprise now, aren’t they?”
</P>
<P>
“Wh…” he stammers. “Why are you showing me this? We… we’re fighting against you.”
</P>
<P>
She smiles again. He wants to forget about the battle.
</P>
<P>
“You’re not. You’re fighting my family, a family that has disrespected your people.”
</P>
<P>
Her words only deepen his expression of disbelief. She tilts her head a little, in an almost playful way.
</P>
<P>
“It’s not only because of my family’s arrogance that the dragons have sided with you. I’ve been following you for a long time Jonas. You are a special man. No usual soldier would have stood up to the Regency. No usual soldier could have trained a squad of Dragon Knights as adept as yours.”
</P>
<P>
He finds that his fear has been replaced with something entirely different, but just as incapacitating for the mind. The Princess is perhaps the most dangerous of all the ruling family, the only one that had bothered to undergo military training. And yet here she is, talking to a traitor, a man who her own parents would love nothing more but to burn at the stake. It doesn’t make sense. It must be a trick.
</P>
<P>
“It’s no trick”, she replies to his thoughts. “It’s your chance to make a difference.”
</P>
<P>
The blue sphere around them starts to shimmer.
</P>
<P>
“I’d like you to come back alive from this mission Jonas. I’d like to meet you in person one day.”
</P>
<P>
Before he can realize what’s going on, she leans over and kisses him on the lips, imparting a jolt of dizzying energy. For a second, it’s light that flows through his veins. He feels like he might faint, but then the cold night air blasts him to wakefulness. The blue sphere and the white shape within are blown away by the wind. He looks behind and sees tiny whirlwinds of sparkling dust get lost underneath his dragon’s wings. He also sees the other dragons following close behind. They continue on the new course. In just half an hour, history will indeed be written.
</P>
<P>
﻿4
</P>
<P>
From the distance, a stray beam of light leaves a rusty scar on the hatch marked with “Asset 84D5-TP”. Two men are approaching, crawling through the moldy corridor, inhaling fetid sewage odors. For these hounds the smell of money overrides any other inconveniences, despite the fact that in this day and age money doesn’t smell anymore. They stop at regular intervals using their flashlights to check the inscriptions on the hatches on both sides of the narrow corridor.
</P>
<P>
“What a sewer. I’m going to enjoy burning this uniform after we’re done here”, says one of them.
</P>
<P>
The other man ignores him. He can sense his partner’s fear. He doesn’t like it, not one bit. Fear is what can turn a successful heist into a one way ticket to the military’s operating table. Thinking of this makes him realize that it would be wise to support his unstable partner.
</P>
<P>
“I think you deserve a flavored keepsake from the day you became rich.”
</P>
<P>
“You’re a funny guy Old, you know that?”
</P>
<P>
But “Old” is not funny. “Old” is calculated, cautious and experienced. “Old” wants to get out of here alive, together with a very expensive piece of hardware if possible. “Old” has been doing runs like this for decades, but never anything so risky. The massive payday they’re about to score has made the gamble seem almost rational. Now, he’s not so sure.
</P>
<P>
They stop to examine another set of opposing hatches. “84D5-TN. Getting close now”, says Ed.
</P>
<P>
The other man lowers his chin so he can talk into the microphone on his uniform. “Glitch, get that hatch opened.”
</P>
<P>
“Roger that”, speaks the robotic voice in their earphones. Glitch’s assumed humanity is melting away sentence after sentence. Old finds comfort in that. Their hacker better be paranoid, because if he gets made then there’s only one way out of this grave. He feels his back pocket just to make sure he still has the neurotoxin pill with him.
</P>
<P>
Meager flashlights are no match for the greedy darkness. Ahead and behind, the corridor seems to stretch forever. This lack of boundary becomes so oppressive that claustrophobia stings worse than in the elevator. They’ve been crawling for about half an hour. Looking at the coarse, unpolished floor, Old realizes that hauling the loot to the elevator will be exhausting. No way will they be able to push or drag the sensitive equipment.
</P>
<P>
They stop in front of yet another pair of hatches. “This is it”, proclaims Ed. “84D5-TP. Let’s get us some asset!”
</P>
<P>
Old chuckles.
</P>
<P>
“What’s so funny grandpa?”
</P>
<P>
“You really haven’t been around these places too much haven’t you?”
</P>
<P>
“How would you know?”
</P>
<P>
“We’re not here for the ‘asset’. We’re here for something the ‘asset’ uses.” Seeing the expression of worry on the other man’s face, Old adds: “don’t worry, I doubt this will affect the operation.” Then, into the microphone: “Glitch, we haven’t got all night, open the hatch already.”
</P>
<P>
“I opened it when you told me to.”
</P>
<P>
For the first time since they met, Old and Ed look at each other with no hostility. Then, as if their primal instincts aligned from that one single glance, together: “It’s closed!”
</P>
<P>
Silence from the other end.
</P>
<P>
“You better open this vault right now or I swear I’ll…” starts Ed.
</P>
<P>
“Give me a minute.”
</P>
<P>
Despite the voice filter, Old can sense frustration in the hacker’s voice. Now he’s worried.
</P>
<P>
“That’s one minute too long! If you think I’m going to just sit here stuck in front of this door you’re wrong. I haven’t risked my neck to…” Ed stops mid-sentence. An absence of background sound in his ear indicates that their hacker muted his microphone. “He hang up!” he yells.
</P>
<P>
“Relax. He’s working on it.” But Old is not relaxed anymore. If Glitch doesn’t get the hatch open, they might as well leave. But this isn’t the first mistake for tonight. His trust in their hacker’s competence is plummeting. What if the entire building has been put on lockdown because he tripped some failsafe?
</P>
<P>
Ed opens and closes his mouth like a fish on the pavement. He punches the floor. “Relax?! Are you insane? He hacks a state of the art military complex and then he can’t open a stupid hatch? And get your flashlight out of my face!”
</P>
<P>
Again, they wait. Ed is right. This isn’t the sort of flop they could expect.
</P>
<P>
“He’s definitely been made. We should get out of here. He got made. He…”
</P>
<P>
A crackling sound in their ears shuts Ed up. “We’ve got a good news bad news situation here so listen up,” starts Glitch. “The good news is that I can open it. The bad news is that I’m calling a fire emergency subroutine so I won’t be able to close it.”
</P>
<P>
“And what’s so bad about that?” asks Old.
</P>
<P>
“There’re delivery drones going through this corridor every three hours or so. If they see an open hatch, we’re in serious trouble. We can call the whole thing off if you want.”
</P>
<P>
“Delivery drones? Why would anybody deliver anything here?” asks Ed.
</P>
<P>
“Just open this damn vault,” demands the old man.
</P>
<P>
“Hey, why the delivery drones?”
</P>
<P>
A metallic clank can be heard from within the round rusty hatch, startling the both of them. A current of stale, putrid air escapes from within the vault. The hatch swings towards inside with a sad but ominous squeak. Ed forgets his question.
</P>
<P>
It’s ironical, Old thinks, that inside this dilapidated building lie some of the military’s most prized assets. The space ahead is just as black as everything here. He crawls inside through a short access corridor. After years of constant leakage the coarse concrete floor is now covered in slippery goo. That is most likely the source of the disgusting smell. It’s good they’ve been down here a while, because if they were to enter in this vault from the fresh air outside, they’d vomit.
</P>
<P>
They’re now in one and only room behind the hatch. Ed’s eyes glimmer with greed as he sees the first light source since they exited the elevator. Against the left wall lies their prize, a metallic cylinder about the size and shape of a small car tire. On it, there’s a small rectangular panel whose LED indicators bask the room in a faint, sick green. A bunch of thick wires extend from it towards the other side of the room.
</P>
<P>
Old watches as Ed traces the destination of the wires. He suspects what will happen next so he gives Ed some space. The beam of the flashlight follows the wires and then moves up half a meter. For a moment, Ed doesn’t say anything. Perhaps he did know what the ‘asset’ is.
</P>
<P>
“What the…” he manages to say before adrenaline kicks in. His palms slip and he lands with his cheek on the gooey floor. He takes a breath of fetid air, serving his nostrils with an overdose of the rancid bouquet. “Aaaah!” he yells. His legs kick left and right as he’s backing against the wall, struggling to keep the spot of light on the ‘asset’, almost expecting it to leap at him.
</P>
<P>
But the ‘asset’ doesn’t move. It just hangs in the air, which makes it seem even more terrifying. A couple of hoses from the ceiling connect to the thing. The wires are ascending to various areas of its black body, most of them towards what appears to be its head. It’s humanoid, thin, almost like a skeleton. There’s nothing supporting its arms and legs, so it appears to be floating. Old points the flashlight to Ed so that he can enjoy the spectacle of his twisted face.
</P>
<P>
“Wh…” Ed sobs. He’s shivering. “What… what… the… the military… they’re hiding… they’re hiding aliens!”
</P>
<P>
A guttural laughter fills the room. Even if they get busted, it was worth it just to see that cocky brat lose his screws over this. It’s better than he expected, much better. Even though he’s sorry for his partner, he can’t stop laughing.
</P>
<P>
“You! You knew! How can you laugh at this? Don’t you realize what this means?”
</P>
<P>
“You’re an idiot Ed. He’s human. But as Glitch said, they don’t travel much… muscle degeneration and all that.”
</P>
<P>
He gives Ed a few more seconds to stare at the skeleton. His breathing slows down a bit. He wipes his check with his shoulder, all the while keeping the spot of light on the vestige of a human body.
</P>
<P>
“Oh, don’t worry kid, he’s in no shape to bite.”
</P>
<P>
“Why’s it floating like that?” Ed’s cockiness is gone. He’s back to being an inexperienced burglar.
</P>
<P>
“Aerogel matrix”, answers Glitch. “Now move it, we don’t have much time. I have no idea when the building’s governor decides to resupply its precious soldiers here.”
</P>
<P>
The old man proceeds to the box. He examines the panel for a few moments then he turns his attention to the wiring.
</P>
<P>
“Soldiers? What do you mean soldiers?” asks Ed.
</P>
<P>
“Boot the skeleton Glitch. I’m going to disconnect his unit.”
</P>
<P>
Ed looks at the skeleton, then at the old man again. “Hey! What do you mean soldiers?” It dawns on him at last that the semblance of a human being wouldn’t even be able to crawl out of here.
</P>
<P>
“Damn it”, says Glitch.
</P>
<P>
“Not again…” moans Old.
</P>
<P>
“I can’t boot him.”
</P>
<P>
“Don’t tell me. There’s a glitch.” Dripping sarcasm floods the floor.
</P>
<P>
“This isn’t funny. If I can’t boot him we can’t remove the unit. It’s against the rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
“I wipe my ass with your rules of engagement, hacker.” Old’s voice is stern and menacing.
</P>
<P>
Ed is still staring at the skeleton. Soldiers, rules of engagement, what did he get into?
</P>
<P>
“Let’s give it ten minutes.” Glitch is almost begging now. “You try from over there, I’ll try and figure out something here.”
</P>
<P>
“Weren’t you the one saying we don’t have much time? I’m giving this five minutes. Ed, move your jelly carcass here and see if we can soft-unplug the unit somehow.”
</P>
<P>
It takes less than three minutes for all of them to realize that there’s nothing to be done. In the end, it’s Glitch who delivers the conclusion. “Ok. Pull it.”
</P>
<P>
﻿5
</P>
<P>
With his fire-bag now empty, Jonas is ready for battle. His mind is rushing and floating over tactical calculations as he anticipates every possible trajectory of the first dozen enemy griffons. He pulls the citrus spray from his belt and squeezes it hard towards his companions sitting behind, on the dragon’s spine. They have been waiting all day for this signal. On cue, they prepare their bows and incendiary bombs.
</P>
<P>
To their delight, half of the griffons aren’t even manned. Their riders are nearby, but nearby is ten seconds closer to death. Jonas grins. Even the wind is on their side today. The enemy hears the huge creatures approaching, but it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Upon the thin wooden arch extending from the dragon’s throat, a prism starts glowing in a dark, voracious red. Jonas touches it and prepares his bow. The dragon’s head moves back. After one final, mighty push, they’re in range of the first griffons. With a blood-curdling growl, the dragon showers the ground with its acid venom. A single, well placed fire arrow from Jonas ignites the first two griffons. Incendiary bombs start falling. Jonas erupts in laughter. They’ve won.
</P>
<P>
As his dragon comes back for another run, a large, triangular portion of the sky starts flickering blue and red. It’s like the side of a huge pyramid. The forest blinks out of existence, replaced by green rectangles.
</P>
<P>
“What is…” he manages, before a mountain shows up in front of them. They fly through it, ending up in a twisted field made up of patches of desert, bricks, starry sky, feathers, clouds and water. Blue and yellow stripes dance across the jumbled pattern below. They look just like the stripes on his visor. It’s like it was stretched to hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
His dragon gets stuck mid-air, everything freezes. A scream from one of the enemy riders gets stuck in time becoming a horrible, screeching wail that drills into his brain. Strange runes start floating on the ground. There is no ground anymore, just a dark blue emptiness. Jonas threshes in his seat. Then, there is no seat. Everything disappears and along with it, so does his strength. He can’t move.
</P>
<P>
Jonas tries to scream but there’s something stuck in his throat. Muscles cramp, his skin starts burning. Then he’s falling, or at least it feels like that. The sensation doesn’t last long. A blast of sharp and unbearable pain all over his body informs him that he hit the ground. So this how dying in a dragon crash feels like. But against all logic, it doesn’t end.
</P>
<P>
Something rakes his face off. His eyes are pulled out of his head. His throat is ripped from his chest. In spite of all this, he’s still somehow in one piece. The sensations contradict themselves like in a nightmare. He can hear himself scream and sees a light so bright he wishes blindness could save him. But his eyes are fine because as the light changes direction, it illuminates the very real face of an old man dressed in strange, black clothes. This can only mean one thing. The Princess betrayed him. He’s in enemy hands.
</P>
<P>
“Whhhhh...” gargles Jonas. He feels liquid spewing over his lips, warming his chin and neck.
</P>
<P>
“Good morning sunshine”, speaks the old man. On his left shoulder he has a magical torch that showers him and the cave in which they seem to be in a cold, white light.
</P>
<P>
“Whiizzzrddd…” he manages before a liquid cough smothers his voice. Against the merciless white light, Jonas sees droplets of bloodied saliva erupting from his own mouth. Now he wishes he really were in a dragon crash instead of being captured by a wizard.
</P>
<P>
“What’s he saying?” asks a younger voice from somewhere behind the old man.
</P>
<P>
“How should I know?” answers the wizard.
</P>
<P>
﻿6
</P>
<P>
Old is crouching next to the skeleton checking the readings on a device he placed on the man’s forehead, even though he doesn’t need a scanner to tell him the guy’s a mess. It’s too bad they had to sever his connection with the unit in this way, but the stakes were too high. Still, even in their line of business there is a place for human rights.
</P>
<P>
“How long is this going to take?” asks Ed.

“Until he calms down a bit and remembers. Now get busy and prepare the unit for transport” answers Old. Then he turns back to the skeleton now lying in a pool of its own feces. He had to cut the suit open in several places so the man doesn’t risk drowning in his own fluids due to reality shock.
</P>
<P>
Bloodied, terrified eyes stare back at him from an emaciated face. There are gashes on his skin wherever the helmet’s material got a bit too friendly with the man’s face. This wasn’t the first time Old pulled somebody out of a suit, but this guy’s condition is so deplorable it might be the last. And besides, once they sell the hardware, Old plans for early retirement.
</P>
<P>
“Whhhhh… whhhhiiiii… whhhhhiiiiiiiizz…” the man gargles. He grunts, convulses, lifts his hand half a centimeter before the effort becomes too much. He starts trembling, coughing.
</P>
<P>
“I know sunshine, I know. You’re having a bit of reality come-back shock. Don’t worry we’re not here to hurt you. And sorry for dropping you, we didn’t know that fancy transmitter of yours controls the aerogel matrix. You dropped like a sack of bones when we started going through the cabling.”
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he takes out a syringe and a black vial from one of the many chest pockets of his uniform. “I’m going to give you a nice shot to relax you and jog your memory a bit.” Then, in his microphone: “What’s his name Glitch?”
</P>
<P>
“File says Jonas. He’s been in here for twenty three years. I reckon he’s quite indispensable to the army. Nothing better than making a good buck while throwing some spanners in the military’s plans.”
</P>
<P>
Ed, give him your earphone.”
</P>
<P>
“What? And then put it back in my ear? No way!”
</P>
<P>
“Show a semblance of compassion man. Do you think this is an easy wakeup for him?” asks Old while he prepares the shot. He turns his attention back to Jonas. “Don’t mind Ed, sunshine.”
</P>
<P>
“Do you smell this place? Who knows what sort of diseases that thing’s carrying?”
</P>
<P>
“Fine, then throw it away afterwards if you want” says Glitch. “Now give him your damn earphone, time’s ticking.”
</P>
<P>
Grumbling, Ed pulls his earphone out and hands it to Old. He inserts it in Jonas’ ear. Afterwards, he injects the drug into one of his skeletal arms.
</P>
<P>
“Jonas, do you remember Sarah or Patrik?” asks Glitch. “They are your parents.”
</P>
<P>
The old man lifts an eyebrow. Glitch is either a woman or has just switched his voice filter to that of a young lady. “Try to remember those names Jonas. Sarah and Patrik. Sarah and Patrik.”
</P>
<P>
The quick acting drug manages to settle Jonas’ twitching and shivering. Glitch continues to repeat the names in a calm but firm voice. There isn’t much hint of understanding on the skeleton’s face. Perhaps he’s trying to remember. Or perhaps his brain is fried. Old crawls to help Ed. They’re half done. With a bit of luck they’ll be out of here within the hour.
</P>
<P>
“What’s Glitch telling him?” asks the other man while the repetition of “Sarah and Patrik” keeps going in Old’s ear.
</P>
<P>
“Oh, so you care now?” The lack of answer is satisfactory. He can intuit his partner’s remorse. “He’s trying to make him remember who he is. He seemed pretty far gone to me so I’m not sure Glitch’s going to make it, even with the elephant dose I squirted in that guy.”
</P>
<P>
“What’s the military doing with these people?”
</P>
<P>
“They’re controllers. They operate machinery, sometimes even trucks or airplanes. I figure this one right here is a pretty important one, since he has this state of the art quantum transmitter… can’t do any fine maneuvering without instant communication.”
</P>
<P>
“Sarah and Patrik” goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
They finish disconnecting the transmitter from the wall. It’s heavier than Old expected. Or perhaps it’s the exhausting night that’s sapping his strength.
</P>
<P>
“Old, give him another dose, take the headphone and go. They’re going to realize he’s gone soon. His off-duty time is almost done.”
</P>
<P>
“Do you think he’s going to remember?”
</P>
<P>
“It’s worth a shot.” The sadistic robotic laughter is back. Behind them, Jonas moans, as if startled.
</P>
<P>
The old man fills another syringe from the vial and empties it in the skeleton’s other arm.  He pats Jonas on the shoulder in a supportive manner. “Sorry again sunshine, it’s just business.” He takes the headphone.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Hot waves caress his body from the inside. Gravity took a vacation, he’s floating, all pain is gone. They’re underneath the clear sky being showered with light and warmth from four suns. A soft hand goes through his hair. The Princess is holding his head in her lap. There are trees nearby. He can hear the wind singing them. She speaks in his mother’s voice. He’s not ready for the real world she says. She’s sorry it turned out this way. What does she mean by the real world? Time is running out, she says.
</P>
<P>
Reality hits like a hammer. The mind poison they gave him works in waves. He’s back in the hellish cave. His eyes have adjusted a bit. He realizes this is not a cave, but a room. Beams of white light play on the coarse gray walls. The wizard and his apprentice are grunting as they drag something out. But is the old man a wizard? He remembers a voice in his left ear. “Sarah and Patrik” it kept saying before the old man took it away. Yes, his parents! A flash from his earlier life flickers by. He doesn’t remember much yet, but he feels that the memory is about to barge in.
</P>
<P>
“Mooooom…” he cries.
</P>
<P>
The old man returns to him. “We’re running out of time sunshine so I’ll have to show you something.” His hand picks up something close to Jonas’ head. With a slow move, he brings it in front of his eyes.
</P>
<P>
It’s a sort of mask out of which two white tubes smudged with blood are hanging, still dripping a yellowish liquid. There is some light flickering in the place where the wearer’s eyes should be. A few pieces of flesh are stuck on the inside. It’s grotesque but somehow familiar. With the corner of his eye, he sees that a sliver of black material connects the terrible object with his own body. The old man holds the mask by some wires and a thick, black hose. Jonas can’t stand the look of it.
</P>
<P>
“No… nooo…”
</P>
<P>
Another wave comes just in time to soften the blow. They’re on the beach now. He sits between his parents, as if he were a little child. There are only three suns on the sky now. The red horizon tells him that the Great One has just set. The Princess is walking towards the water. A thin veil covers her body. The breeze steals it when the first wave touches her feet. A pair of dragons flies up above. He notices an aircraft carrier in the blue sea. Father gets up and walks away. Mother leans to him and whispers that he shouldn’t have joined the military. Somebody is shaking him. What do they want now? He’s done with today’s mission. This is his own time now.
</P>
<P>
“Remember when you first put one of these on?” asks the old man still holding Jonas’ mask.
</P>
<P>
Yes, the mask, the haptic suit, the enrollment form, his debts, a promise to serve the country, disappointed parents, a hate for some enemy, airstrikes, guided missiles. But then come the elven maidens, the dragons, the four suns, the warlocks, the glory, all his for a day’s work. Memories are scattered in a whirlwind of lives he might have lived. But it’s all fake. The only reality is that of the old man that ripped his mask off.
</P>
<P>
“You… you’re not a… whiz… wizard.”
</P>
<P>
The old man chuckles. “I’d wish sunshine, I’d wish. I’d just clap my palms and whisk us all out of here in a jiffy.” Then, in a stern voice: “Rank and name!”
</P>
<P>
A well-formed reflex kicks in. “Colonel, 84D5-TP at… at your service,” he speaks in a broken voice. As he utters the last syllable, he’s off again. This time it’s the deck of an aircraft carrier. A man is barking orders at him. He seems angry. Jonas doesn’t care. Their war toys are just money wasted in futile posturing. He will meet the Princess after this pointless training mission is done. She’ll forgive his sins. The Blue Twins are up on the sky. But didn’t Earth have only one sun? Wait. Earth!
</P>
<P>
“You hear that Glitch? He’s back. Well, as back as he can be given the way he’s tripping.”
</P>
<P>
Another man shows himself. It’s the owner of the other voice Jonas has been hearing.
</P>
<P>
“Let’s move it Old. Time to get rich.”
</P>
<P>
“How… how long… long was…” starts Jonas. He can’t muster much strength. The drug is coming at him again.
</P>
<P>
“Ah, the most common question. According to our hacker, about twenty three years,” answers Old.
</P>
<P>
It can’t be. It just can’t be. He runs away to a mountain cabin. Outside, the gray sky sieves sparse snowflakes. He looks for the Princess but can’t see her. Behind thin clouds he can sometimes see a small red dot. It’s the Tiny One. Judging by the dark twilight outside, the Tiny One is the only sun on the sky so it must be early morning or late at night. Somebody knocks at the door. He opens it without a second thought. The old man smiles at him. Then, he pulls his face off, showing Jonas his virtual reality helmet. Jonas throws up in both realities.
</P>
<P>
The one called Old regards him with compassion. He uses a piece of Jonas’ own suit to wipe the barf off his cheeks. It burns to be looked at in that way. But those few seconds of empathy have an effect stronger than that of the drug.
</P>
<P>
The old man cocks his head to one side, as if listening to something. His expression changes. He pats Jonas on the shoulder. “Your friends are coming sunshine. Time for us to make our exit.”
</P>
<P>
Jonas panics. He can feel the drug preparing to snatch him back into himself, except that he doesn’t want to go under. Not now!
</P>
<P>
“No… not friends. Don’t… don’t leave me here!”
</P>
<P>
“Don’t worry. You’re stable now. They’ll patch you up, mess with your memory a bit and you’ll be back playing with wizards soon enough.”
</P>
<P>
With surprising agility he crawls over to his c0mpanion. Together, they move the communications unit outside Jonas’ room. He comes back for one final look. He feigns a military salute, chuckles and then disappears. A dragon’s claw tries to catch him but ends up a few centimeters short. Reality is slipping away.
</P>
<P>
“… but…” he manages before the drug is back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
He’s buried. Somewhere underneath the cracked, old asphalt there is a maze of apartments made for the willing or less willing slaves of digital warfare. Robotic drones feed them cheap goo just enough to keep them alive until their reflexes become too poor to be worth feeding. He looks towards the sky through twenty eight floors of stinking, oozing tunnels built in the cheapest possible way. A black, sick sun as large as a dried up twisted Universe laughs back at him. Welcome home, the black sun sneers. He looks for the Princess. Shiny beautiful memories turn into burned plastic. Now she’s just a ghoul, a prop, the cheap bait they used to devour his life. With the sound of a crushed diamond crown, he accepts reality. Jonas is not flying anymore.
