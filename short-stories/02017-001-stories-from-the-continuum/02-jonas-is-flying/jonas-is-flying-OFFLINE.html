Jonas Is Flying 
</H1>
<P>
﻿1
</P>
<P>
Jonas is flying. Across the lands below autumn is on parade. A myriad warm colors spill from hill to hill, right up to the feet of the nearby mountains. There aren’t many farms out here, but the few fields he does see have already been emptied of their crop. Winter is not far at all. It is already turning mountain peaks into white fangs that pierce the darkening sky. Strong currents of cold air coming from there often force him to check his compass and adjust course.
</P>
<P>
Any delay would mean certain doom. There is a battle to be fought and Jonas intends to turn the tide of what has so far been a disastrous campaign. It’s not often that an air strike is affordable, but they’ve been losing ground for months. This is their last chance to secure important land before winter will slow the war down to a grueling crawl.
</P>
<P>
He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to better shield his eyes from the frigid air through which he and his companions are rushing. Despite the mounting pressure brought by the importance of their mission, Jonas is ecstatic. Every now and then, he takes a puff from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke from his nostrils as he looks up, grinning towards the skies.
</P>
<P>
He can sometimes hear the war chants from behind him. They have trained hard for this day. Now, in the few hours they have until they reach the battleground, his friends have time for a little fun. They’re strapped in their places down below where speed of their flight is less harmful for human interaction.
</P>
<P>
The smell of dry leaves makes its way to them as they fly over the rusty forest covering a tall hilltop. Among the trees, a thin brown line can sometimes be seen. They’re close enough for Jonas’ sharp eyes to spot a loaded carriage making its way along the road. It’s pulled by an ox, so he assumes these must be some rich farmers trying to move some of their crop behind the walls of the nearest castle. The villages in these border areas have been warned that the enemy has crossed the great river in the west. A difficult winter is heading their way. But Jonas means to change all that. He finds himself wondering how history will remember this day.
</P>

<P>
The elevator’s doors slam shut with a soft thump leaving its occupants in complete darkness. There’s barely enough space for the two men inside to huddle together, crouching and kneeling, with the back of their necks pressed firmly against the metal ceiling. It wasn’t meant to transport humans or any living thing for that matter. They wait for the elevator to start moving. Nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
This has not been a good night. They almost got caught when they broke into the building. A proximity sensor hadn’t been listed on their map. After tripping the alarm they went hiding behind the first door they could open. It was a mix of luck and incompetence that saved them. The soldiers patrolling the ground floor didn’t bother to check their own locker room.
</P>
<P>
In this country, the punishment for meddling in the military’s affairs is worse than death. A mysterious employer and the guarantee of a fat payday had made the risk seem worth it. But now the unbearable delay makes the two men reconsider their choices. Within seconds, the metal box turns into an inspiration for their worst nightmares. The silence is suffocating. Cold sweat. Racing hearts. Frozen thought.
</P>
<P>
With a subtle jolt, their prison starts its descent. One of the men lets out a sigh of relief. He shuffles, trying to shift his weight from his aching knees. His partner is tense like a bow’s string and unmoving like a rock. The smell of sewage they felt when entering the building is getting worse. It doesn’t help them to think that the elevator’s destination is about thirty meters below street level.
</P>
<P>
“I sure hope we don’t splash into anything”, says a trembling, weary voice.
</P>
<P>
“Shut up old man”, comes the stiff answer. They don’t know each other’s real name, having met less than an hour ago on a nearby street. It was enough time to realize they’ll get along like water and oil.
</P>
<P>
“Relax Ed”, says a voice in both their ears. “Nobody bothers eavesdrop this grave”. It’s Glitch, the man or woman who supervises this heist. It’s hard to know because the voice is passed through a cheap filter that makes it sound like an action movie robot from the early twenties.
</P>
<P>
It’s getting hot. Silence swallows their words and breaths. Ed realizes that keeping his mouth shut isn’t that easy after all. Why is it so quiet? Does this damned elevator even have a motor? Is it still moving? Bothered by doubt his mind calls upon imagination to discourage the current course of action. Imagination obliges. He sees himself facing sentencing after a summary trial. His wife is there, crying. No, wait, that’s ridiculous. He sees himself on the operating table, no trial at all. His wife has already been converted.
</P>
<P>
“Why couldn’t you fix us a normal elevator Glitch? You’re supposed to own this entire building now, aren’t you?” asks Ed. His imagination pouts. It doesn’t like interruptions.
</P>
<P>
“Because controlling a building is not as easy as hacking a delivery truck and making it drive me around the neighborhood. And because there aren’t any normal elevators here.” Then, after a short pause Glitch treats them to one of his sadistic jokes: “These guys don’t get out much”. Cue the annoying robotic laughter.
</P>
<P>
“How large is the unit?” asks the old man.
</P>
<P>
“Large enough for one of you to stay behind and contemplate betrayal by the others and imagine a life of serving the Watchers.” That laughter again, same intonation, same length, he’s probably using a sample.
</P>
<P>
“This’ll be one case when age won’t come before beauty”, sneers Ed. The other man ignores him. It’s the worst possible answer.
</P>
<P>
Without any warning, the doors open. Ed almost lets out a scream. He keeps quiet, but the old man chuckles. He must’ve felt him tense up. Ed wants to ask him how long has it been since they stopped but his pride is stronger than his curiosity.
</P>
<P>
The old man turns on the flashlight on his shoulder. A gray corridor extends for as far as they can see. The flashlight increases its output as their eyes adjust to the bright light. The corridor is not much taller than the elevator but at least it’s wider. They crawl out and stretch on the floor in the only direction they can.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is lined with metal hatches on both sides. Less than two meters separate each hatch. This place is very crowded. Ed turns on his own light. Not even two fully powered directional flashlights can help them see the end of the corridor. There must be hundreds if not thousands of rooms on this level alone.
</P>
<P>
He notices that the builders haven’t even bothered to install light sources in this place. These walls had never seen the light of day, he realizes. A chill tiptoes down his spine, beckoning his imagination to come out and play. Imagination obliges. They’re going to get trapped here. No, that’s ridiculous. They’re going to live here. Or at least he is. The old man will probably get out with the loot and together with Glitch he’s going to laugh all the way to the Corporation or to whatever shady institution would be willing to pay top credit for the tech they’re about to steal.
</P>

</P>
<P>
It’s dark now. A farmer and his two helpers have just finished repairing their carriage. They are rushing along a forest road [?], eager to get back to the safety of the village. Grunting as they pull the overloaded thing, nobody heeds the trees stirring behind them. A single torch is fighting a losing battle against the darkness. Swarms of shadows squirm all around the path. Then they hear a strange sound coming from behind them. It’s almost like a breath, the breath of something very large.
</P>
<P>
“What was that?” asks one of the helpers.
</P>
<P>
The farmer turns to answer but before he can open his mouth, he’s slapped by a gust of unnatural wind. Above them, the trees protest, showering them with dead leaves and broken twigs. Their torch is extinguished in an instant, leaving a trail of glowing red tears swirling around them. Then, the only light is that of the stars above. They look there, almost expecting something to happen. Another blast of wind as a black shape crosses the starry landscape. Trapped inside their own bodies, locked by an overriding survival instinct, the farmers wait for the creatures to pass praying that none of them stops for an easy snack.
</P>
<P>
But Jonas and his squad have more pressing matters to attend to. He had noticed the peasants’ torch from many miles away. On another day he might have avoided flying above them, but now he cannot afford even the slightest change in course. In his hands, the metal rod that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic.
</P>
<P>
They are close now. Up ahead, far away, the battle is in full swing. Sometimes, green lighting flashes behind the smoke that rises from the battleground. The enemy warlocks had entered the fray as soon as the sun set. No purple lightning so far, which means that their own wizards are probably bidding their time until the air support arrives. He just hopes the infantry doesn’t get wiped out until then.
</P>
<P>
He takes another puff from his fire-bag. The wave of focus and relaxation is just about perfect, but not quite there. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. Eyes closed, he clutches the steering rod knowing that another river of cold mountain air lies in front of them. Jonas is one with the wind now. In his mind, he sees the great mountains shape the air across the land. He feels the dragon’s mighty push through his every vertebrae as the creature’s huge wings push them towards their destiny.
</P>
<P>
Then, against all his strength, he feels the steering rod tilt to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. There is somebody else’s hand on the rod. He grabs it even before opening his eyes in anger and surprise. There’s only room for a single pilot underneath the dragon’s scaled throat. But the one that has taken over his creature is not sitting next to Jonas, but rather floating in the air just in front of him.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a shimmering blue sphere is the last person he expected to see today. She looks straight into his soul, expressing wrathful patience. Her blue eyes beg him to keep hold of her hand, but the diamond crown on her head punishes his transgression. Jonas immediately lets go. He throws his hands to his sides, in unconditioned surrender. They’ve been discovered. The mission is over.
</P>
<P>
“Majesty…” he manages to whisper, knowing that his word will be smothered by the torrents of air as soon as it leaves his lips.
</P>
<P>
With a gracious wave of her hand, she extends her magical shield around him. Inside the holy silence, his own heartbeat terrifies him. She’s going to crash them into the ground. Or worse, she’s going to turn him against his own people.
</P>
<P>
“Hello Jonas”, she says. Her voice makes his hair stand. Despite its innocence, there is power beyond human understanding in her every syllable.
</P>
<P>
Jonas can’t dare look behind, but he hopes that the rest of the squad has not been tricked into following the new direction. Dragons are immune to most spells, but not their pilots. What if she’s not alone? There are certain measures that can be taken against spell-casters. Jonas is well trained in them. But in front of him is no usual caster. Covered in a simple white and silver robe is the Ivory Princess herself.
</P>
<P>
He’s too scared to think what to do next so he just sits there with his hands still at his sides, having relinquished complete control of his dragon. The woman smiles at him. He sinks inside her dark eyes.
</P>
<P>
“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to hurt you.”
</P>
<P>
The dragon continues its flight unabated. His pilot instincts scream against the violation of the rules of nature. Below, the ground moves at dizzying speed and above, not a single lock of her blonde hair moves. They’re sitting in a bubble of calmness where even a stray, green firefly has found refuge.
</P>
<P>
With slow movements, the Princess draws a rectangle in the space between them. He watches her index finger scar the air with its sharp whiteness. She’s drawing a map. On it, with her other fingers, she leaves several colored marks.
</P>
<P>
“That’s where the warlocks are”, she says while placing more marks on the map. “And that’s where the griffons are. They’ll be expecting you to attack the warlocks from the north. But they’re in for a surprise now, aren’t they?”
</P>
<P>
“Wh…” he stammers. “Why are you showing me this? We… we’re fighting against you.”
</P>
<P>
She smiles again. He wants to forget about the battle.
</P>
<P>
“You’re not. You’re fighting my family, a family that has disrespected your people.”
</P>
<P>
Her words only deepen his expression of disbelief. She tilts her head a little, in an almost playful way.
</P>
<P>
“It’s not only because of my family’s arrogance that the dragons have sided with you. I’ve been following you for a long time Jonas. You are a special man. No usual soldier would have stood up to the Regency. No usual soldier could have trained a squad of Dragon Knights as adept as yours.”
</P>
<P>
He finds that his fear has been replaced with something entirely different, but just as incapacitating for the mind. The Princess is perhaps the most dangerous of all the ruling family, the only one that had bothered to undergo military training. And yet here she is, talking to a traitor, a man who her own parents would love nothing more but to burn at the stake. It doesn’t make sense. It must be a trick.
</P>
<P>
“It’s no trick”, she replies to his thoughts. “It’s your chance to make a difference.”
</P>
<P>
The blue sphere around them starts to shimmer.
</P>
<P>
“I’d like you to come back alive from this mission Jonas. I’d like to meet you in person one day.”
</P>
<P>
Before he can realize what’s going on, she leans over and kisses him on the lips, imparting a jolt of dizzying energy. For a second, it’s light that flows through his veins. He feels like he might faint, but then the cold night air blasts him to wakefulness. The blue sphere and the white shape within are blown away by the wind. He looks behind and sees tiny whirlwinds of sparkling dust get lost underneath his dragon’s wings. He also sees the other dragons following close behind. They continue on the new course. In just half an hour, history will indeed be written.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
From the distance, a stray beam of light bounces off the hatch marked with “Asset NLRV-90-400-P4”. The last time this piece of metal was touched by any light was decades ago when it left a Chinese factory to be shipped across the ocean. Two men are approaching, crawling through the moldy corridor, inhaling fetid sewage odors. For these two hounds, the smell of money overrides other inconveniences, despite the fact that in this day and age, money doesn’t smell anymore.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
With his fire-bag now empty, Jonas prepares for battle. He’d been smoking potent Indica, so now his mind is rushing and floating over tactical calculations as he anticipates the trajectory of the three enemy black dragons. He pulls the citrus spray from his belt and squeezes it hard towards his friends. On cue, they prepare their bows and light up the fireballs on top of their staves.
</P>
<P>
As the first fire ball gloriously hits the last enemy dragon, Jonas feels water flowing on his face. A large portion of the sky becomes black and starts to flicker with menacing red colors.
</P>
<P>
“What the…” he manages, before a mountain shows up in front of them. They fly through it, into darkness, while in the same time blue and yellow stripes dance around him. They look just like the stripes on his hat. He looks back. His men are gone, so is the dragon. His entire body starts hurting, then convulsing. And suddenly, he’s falling. He draws a panicky breath, but instead of air, he draws water.
</P>
<P>
Jonas is drowning. He kicks and threshes into his tank. At last, he manages to rip the virtual reality headset from his face, along with the oxygen tube. He can’t see anything. There must’ve been a power outage, but his tank was equipped with a redundant backup system. His feeble legs kick the tank’s window, but after the months he’s been spending here, he could hardly have the power to walk down a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
His muscles cramp, he tries to scream but the water won’t let him. Horror crumples his sanity. Suddenly, the light opens in the room outside. Frenetically, he starts searching his VR helmet. But then he sees something moving. Under his dying gaze, two masked men are hauling his backup generators towards the exit in a rusty cart, along with his top of the line entertainment system.
</P>
<P>
He kicks one more time, with all his might. This time, the window breaks and a bit of water starts trickling outside. One of the masked men stops and produces a flashlight. He looks inside and panics when he sees the submerged victim. He starts screaming something that Jonas can’t understand and runs away along with his companion.
