Jonas Is Flying 
</H1>
<P>
﻿1
</P>
<P>
Jonas is flying. Across the lands below autumn is on parade. A myriad warm colors spill from hill to hill, right up to the feet of the nearby mountains. There aren’t many farms out here, but the few fields he does see have already been emptied of their crop. Winter is not far at all. It is already turning mountain peaks into white fangs that pierce the darkening sky. Strong currents of cold air coming from there often force him to check his compass and adjust course.
</P>
<P>
Any delay would mean certain doom. There is a battle to be fought and Jonas intends to turn the tide of what has so far been a disastrous campaign. It’s not often that an air strike is affordable, but they’ve been losing ground for months. This is their last chance to secure important land before winter will slow the war down to a grueling crawl.
</P>
<P>
He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to better shield his eyes from the frigid air through which he and his companions are rushing. Despite the mounting pressure brought by the importance of their mission, Jonas is ecstatic. Every now and then, he takes a puff from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke from his nostrils as he looks up, grinning towards the skies.
</P>
<P>
He can sometimes hear the war chants from behind him. They have trained hard for this day. Now, in the few hours they have until they reach the battleground, his friends have time for a little fun. They’re strapped in their places down below where speed of their flight is less harmful for human interaction.
</P>
<P>
The smell of dry leaves makes its way to them as they fly over the rusty forest covering a tall hilltop. Among the trees, a thin brown line can sometimes be seen. They’re close enough for Jonas’ sharp eyes to spot a loaded carriage making its way along the road. It’s pulled by an ox, so he assumes these must be some rich farmers trying to move some of their crop behind the walls of the nearest castle. The villages in these border areas have been warned that the enemy has crossed the great river in the west. A difficult winter is heading their way. But Jonas means to change all that. He finds himself wondering how history will remember this day.

The elevator’s doors slam shut with a soft thump leaving its occupants in complete darkness. There’s barely enough space for the two men inside to huddle together, crouching and kneeling, with the back of their necks pressed firmly against the metal ceiling. It wasn’t meant to transport humans or any living thing for that matter. They wait for the elevator to start moving. Nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
This has not been a good night. They almost got caught when they broke into the building. A proximity sensor hadn’t been listed on their map. After tripping the alarm they went hiding behind the first door they could open. It was a mix of luck and incompetence that saved them. The soldiers patrolling the ground floor didn’t bother to check their own locker room.
</P>
<P>
In this country, the punishment for meddling in the military’s affairs is worse than death. A mysterious employer and the guarantee of a fat payday had made the risk seem worth it. But now the unbearable delay makes the two men reconsider their choices. Within seconds, the metal box turns into an inspiration for their worst nightmares. The silence is suffocating. Cold sweat. Racing hearts. Frozen thought.
</P>
<P>
With a subtle jolt, their prison starts its descent. One of the men lets out a sigh of relief. He shuffles, trying to shift his weight from his aching knees. His partner is tense like a bow’s string and unmoving like a rock. The smell of sewage they felt when entering the building is getting worse. It doesn’t help them to think that the elevator’s destination is about thirty meters below street level.
</P>
<P>
“I sure hope we don’t splash into anything”, says a trembling, weary voice.
</P>
<P>
“Shut up old man”, comes the stiff answer. They don’t know each other’s real name, having met less than an hour ago on a nearby street. It was enough time to realize they’ll get along like water and oil.
</P>
<P>
“Relax Ed”, says a voice in both their ears. “Nobody bothers eavesdrop this grave”. It’s Glitch, the man or woman who supervises this heist. It’s hard to know because the voice is passed through a cheap filter that makes it sound like an action movie robot from the early twenties.
</P>
<P>
It’s getting hot. Silence swallows their words and breaths. Ed realizes that keeping his mouth shut isn’t that easy after all. Why is it so quiet? Does this damned elevator even have a motor? Is it still moving? Bothered by doubt his mind calls upon imagination to discourage the current course of action. Imagination obliges. He sees himself facing sentencing after a summary trial. His wife is there, crying. No, wait, that’s ridiculous. He sees himself on the operating table, no trial at all. His wife has already been converted.
</P>
<P>
“Why couldn’t you fix us a normal elevator Glitch? You’re supposed to own this entire building now, aren’t you?” asks Ed. His imagination pouts. It doesn’t like interruptions.
</P>
<P>
“Because controlling a building is not as easy as hacking a delivery truck and making it drive me around the neighborhood. And because there aren’t any normal elevators here.” Then, after a short pause Glitch treats them to one of his sadistic jokes: “These guys don’t get out much”. Cue the annoying robotic laughter.
</P>
<P>
“How large is the unit?” asks the old man.
</P>
<P>
“Large enough for one of you to stay behind and contemplate betrayal by the others and imagine a life of serving the Watchers.” That laughter again, same intonation, same length, he’s probably using a sample.
</P>
<P>
“This’ll be one case when age won’t come before beauty”, sneers Ed. The other man ignores him. It’s the worst possible answer.
</P>
<P>
Without any warning, the doors open. Ed almost lets out a scream. He keeps quiet, but the old man chuckles. He must’ve felt him tense up. Ed wants to ask him how long has it been since they stopped but his pride is stronger than his curiosity.
</P>
<P>
The old man turns on the flashlight on his shoulder. A gray corridor extends for as far as they can see. The flashlight increases its output as their eyes adjust to the bright light. The corridor is not much taller than the elevator but at least it’s wider. They crawl out and stretch on the floor in the only direction they can.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is lined with metal hatches on both sides. Less than two meters separate each hatch. This place is very crowded. Ed turns on his own light. Not even two fully powered directional flashlights can help them see the end of the corridor. There must be hundreds if not thousands of rooms on this level alone.
</P>
<P>
He notices that the builders haven’t even bothered to install light sources in this place. These walls had never seen the light of day, he realizes. A chill tiptoes down his spine, beckoning his imagination to come out and play. Imagination obliges. They’re going to get trapped here. No, that’s ridiculous. They’re going to live here. Or at least he is. The old man will probably get out with the loot and together with Glitch he’s going to laugh all the way to the Corporation or to whatever shady institution would be willing to pay top credit for the tech they’re about to steal.
</P>

<P>
In his hands, the metal rod that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic. Now and then, he has to change the position of his hands, warming up another part of the cold rod.
</P>
<P>
He takes another puff from his fire-bag and closes his eyes for a bit. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. He feels the dragon’s kick in his spine as the creature’s mighty wings push them towards their destiny. Then he feels the rod tilt to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. He immediately opens his eyes. There is somebody else’s hand on the rod and he reflexively grabs it before even looking to his right. The feeling of warm, exposed skin, wakes him up to the impossibility of the situation: at this height, at this speed, there is no warm skin.
</P>
<P>
She looks right through him, expressing wrathful patience. Her blue eyes beg him to keep hold of her hand, but the diamond crown on her head punishes his transgression. Jonas immediately lets go.
</P>
<P>
“Majesty! You should not be here!” he screams, trying to make himself heard in spite of the torrents of air. But as soon as she opens her mouth to speak, a translucent sphere engulfs them and an almost holy silence surrounds them. Jonas, like any of the Majesty’s Dragon Knights, is aware that the princess is an adept spell caster. Yet, his pilot instincts scream against the violation of the rules of nature. Below, the ground moves at dizzying speed and above, they’re sitting in a bubble of calmness where even a stray green dragonfly has found refuge.
</P>
<P>
“I go and observe where I please,” she answers back in the sweetest voice. With a gracious index finger, she draws a rectangle in front of them, and a mirror materializes out of thin air. Strange symbols and runes appear on its surface and Jonas can easily make out the enemy dragons approaching The Battleground. With this information, he might easily win the contest.
</P>
<P>
“Why did you show me this?” he asks, unbelieving.
</P>
<P>
“Because I want you to come back alive.”
</P>
<P>
Before he can reply, she leans over and kisses him on the lips, imparting such a jolt of energy that he can barely withstand. He feels like he might faint, but then the air blasts him again and the princess is gone. The dragon continues on the new course. In just half an hour they will attack the enemy dragons from behind, and he will arrive back at the castle as the Champion.

With his fire-bag now empty, Jonas prepares for battle. He’d been smoking potent Indica, so now his mind is rushing and floating over tactical calculations as he anticipates the trajectory of the three enemy black dragons. He pulls the citrus spray from his belt and squeezes it hard towards his friends. On cue, they prepare their bows and light up the fireballs on top of their staves.
</P>
<P>
As the first fire ball gloriously hits the last enemy dragon, Jonas feels water flowing on his face. A large portion of the sky becomes black and starts to flicker with menacing red colors.
</P>
<P>
“What the…” he manages, before a mountain shows up in front of them. They fly through it, into darkness, while in the same time blue and yellow stripes dance around him. They look just like the stripes on his hat. He looks back. His men are gone, so is the dragon. His entire body starts hurting, then convulsing. And suddenly, he’s falling. He draws a panicky breath, but instead of air, he draws water.
</P>
<P>
Jonas is drowning. He kicks and threshes into his tank. At last, he manages to rip the virtual reality headset from his face, along with the oxygen tube. He can’t see anything. There must’ve been a power outage, but his tank was equipped with a redundant backup system. His feeble legs kick the tank’s window, but after the months he’s been spending here, he could hardly have the power to walk down a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
His muscles cramp, he tries to scream but the water won’t let him. Horror crumples his sanity. Suddenly, the light opens in the room outside. Frenetically, he starts searching his VR helmet. But then he sees something moving. Under his dying gaze, two masked men are hauling his backup generators towards the exit in a rusty cart, along with his top of the line entertainment system.
</P>
<P>
He kicks one more time, with all his might. This time, the window breaks and a bit of water starts trickling outside. One of the masked men stops and produces a flashlight. He looks inside and panics when he sees the submerged victim. He starts screaming something that Jonas can’t understand and runs away along with his companion.
