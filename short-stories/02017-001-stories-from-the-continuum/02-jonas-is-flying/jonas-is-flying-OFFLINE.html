Jonas Is Flying 
</H1>
<P>
﻿1
</P>
<P>
Across the lands below autumn is on parade. A myriad warm colors spill from hill to hill, right up to the feet of the nearby mountains. There aren’t many farms out here, but the few fields he does see have already been harvested. Winter is not far at all. It is already turning mountain peaks into white fangs that pierce the darkening sky. Strong currents of cold air coming from there often force him to check his compass and adjust course.
</P>
<P>
Any delay would mean certain doom. There is a battle to be fought and Jonas intends to turn the tide of what has so far been a disastrous campaign. It’s not often that an air strike is affordable, but they’ve been losing ground for months. This is their last chance to secure important land before winter will slow the war down to a grueling crawl.
</P>
<P>
He adjusts his flight hat, trying to get the worn visor to better shield his eyes from the frigid air through which he and his companions are rushing. His thick, blonde hair is covered in protective oils. A simple dark brown leather flight suit wraps his battle-honed body. Despite the mounting pressure brought by the importance of their mission, Jonas is ecstatic. Every now and then, he uses a silver tube to take a deep breath from the leather bag on his shoulder. The wind snaps the smoke from his nostrils as he looks up, grinning towards the skies.
</P>
<P>
He can sometimes hear his brethren’s war chants from further back. They have trained hard for this day. Now, in the few hours they have until they reach the battleground, the warriors are allowed to pass the time in the most joyful way they can, for these may be their last hours alive. They’re sitting back-to-back, strapped in their places and to each other by thick ropes. Some are armed with crossbows while others hold strings of glass baubles.
</P>
<P>
The smell of dry leaves makes its way to them as they soar over the rusty forest covering a tall hilltop. Among the trees, a thin brown line can sometimes be seen. They’re flying close enough for Jonas’ sharp eyes to spot several loaded carriages making their way along the road. He’s surprised to see people out in the forest this late. They must be desperate. The carriages are pulled by oxen and escorted by several riders, so he assumes these must be some rich farmers trying to move some of their crops behind the walls of the nearest castle. The villages in these border areas have been warned that the enemy has crossed the great river in the west. A difficult winter may be heading their way. But Jonas means to change all that. He finds himself wondering how history will remember this day.

</P>
<P>
The tiny elevator’s doors seal shut with a soft thump leaving its occupants in complete darkness. There’s barely enough space for the two inside to huddle together, crouching and kneeling, with the back of their necks pressed firmly against the metal ceiling. It wasn’t meant to transport humans or any living thing for that matter. They wait for the elevator to start moving. Nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
This has not been a good night. They almost got caught when they broke into the building. A proximity sensor didn’t figure on their map. After tripping the alarm they went hiding behind the first door they could open. It was a mix of luck and incompetence that saved them. The soldiers patrolling the ground floor didn’t bother to check their own locker room.
</P>
<P>
In this country, the punishment for meddling in the military’s affairs is worse than death. A mysterious employer and the guarantee of a fat payday had made the risk seem worth it. But now, the unbearable delay makes the two partners in crime reconsider their choices. Within seconds, the metal box turns into an inspiration for their worst nightmares. The silence is suffocating. Cold sweat. Racing hearts. Frozen thought.
</P>
<P>
With a subtle jolt, their prison starts its descent. The man lets out a sigh of relief. He struggles, trying to shift his weight from his aching knees. His accomplice is tense like a bow’s string and unmoving like a rock. The smell of sewage they felt when entering the building is getting worse. It doesn’t help to think that the elevator’s destination is about thirty meters below street level.
</P>
<P>
“I sure hope we don’t splash into anything”, grumbles the man.
</P>
<P>
“Shut up grandpa,” answers a raspy feminine voice. They don’t know each other’s real name, having met less than an hour ago on poorly lit nearby street.
</P>
<P>
It didn’t take long for her to realize they’ll get along like water and oil. An aura of rigid discipline emanated from the old man. His black, featureless trench coat was in perfect tune with his sharp moves and stiff demeanor.  His machine-trimmed white hair reminded her of an abusive alcoholic uncle. But what she now realizes she hates most is people who talk too much during an op. Every word can be transformed into evidence these days.
</P>
<P>
“Relax Red”, speaks a voice in both their ears. “Nobody bothers eavesdrop this grave”. It’s Glitch, the man or woman who supervises this heist. They use “he”, but it’s hard to know because the voice is passed through a cheap filter that makes it sound like an action movie robot from the early twenties.
</P>
<P>
It’s getting hot. Greedy silence swallows their words and breaths. Red realizes that keeping her mouth shut isn’t that easy after all. Why is it so quiet? Is the elevator still moving? What if they’ve been discovered? Bothered by doubt her mind calls upon imagination to discourage the current course of action. Imagination obliges. She sees herself facing sentencing after a summary trial. Her daughter is there, crying. No, wait, that’s ridiculous. She sees herself in a holding cell, no trial at all. Her daughter has been shoved in some military school as payback for her mother’s actions against “national security”.
</P>
<P>
“Why couldn’t you fix us a normal elevator Glitch? You’re supposed to own this entire building by now, aren’t you?” asks Red. Her imagination pouts. It doesn’t like interruptions.
</P>
<P>
“Because working a building is not as easy as hacking a delivery truck and making it drive me around the neighborhood. And because there aren’t any normal elevators here.” Then, after a short pause Glitch treats them to one of his sadistic jokes: “These guys don’t travel much”. Cue the annoying robotic laughter.
</P>
<P>
“How large is the unit?” asks the old man.
</P>
<P>
“Large enough for one of you to stay behind and contemplate betrayal by the others while looking at the elevator’s doors.” That laughter again, same intonation, same length, he’s probably using a sample.
</P>
<P>
“This’ll be one case when age won’t come before beauty”, sneers Red. The old man ignores her. It’s the worst possible answer. The truth is she doesn’t feel beautiful at all. The tight uniform strangles her large body and itches all over while her sweat is beginning to make friends with the foul smell of this place.
</P>
<P>
Without any warning, the doors open. Red almost lets out a scream. She manages to hold it in, but her companion chuckles. He must’ve felt her tense up, the sly bastard. Thoughts of treachery worm their way into her mind. She wants to ask him how long it has been since they stopped but pride defeats curiosity.
</P>
<P>
The old man turns on the flashlight on his shoulder. A bleak gray corridor extends for as far as they can see. The air is musty and thick so the light doesn’t make it very far before it gets asphyxiated into a blurry brown blotch. The corridor is wider but not much taller than the elevator. They crawl out on all fours. Claustrophobia is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is lined with round metal hatches on both sides. Less than two meters separate each hatch. This place is very crowded. Red turns on her own light and illuminates the inscription on the round doorway to her right. “Asset 81A-F” it says. She looks at the screen on her wrist. According to Glitch, the target is more than a kilometer away. There must be hundreds if not thousands of vaults on this level alone.
</P>
<P>
It’s even warmer here than in the elevator. Annoyed, she removes her bandana before her head can pop like corn in the microwave. Her companion scoffs at the sight of her crooked mohawk.
</P>
<P>
“What are you trying to do with that hairdo? Catch some spiders?”
</P>
<P>
“Shut up geezer.”
</P>
<P>
She notices that the builders haven’t even bothered to install light sources in this place. These walls have never seen the light of day, she realizes. A chill tiptoes down her spine, beckoning her imagination to come out and play. Imagination obliges. They’re going to get caught. No, that’s too easy. They’re going to live here for a couple of days. Long after they run out of electricity and water, they’re going to beg to be taken into custody. If they’re lucky, they might even see the sky on one last day before being sent to wherever the military stashes traitors these days. Even better, continues her imagination unabated, she’s going to go through the ordeal all alone. The old man will probably make it out with the loot. Together with Glitch, he’s going to laugh all the way to the Corporation or to whatever dubious institution will be willing to pay top credit for the tech they’re about to steal.
</P>
<P>
﻿3It’s dark now. A farmer and his two helpers have just finished repairing their carriage. They’re trudging along a forest road, eager to get back to the safety of the village. Grunting as they pull the overloaded thing, none heeds the trees stirring behind them, closer and closer. A single torch is fighting a losing battle against the darkness. Swarms of shadows squirm all around the path. At last they realize something is coming from behind them. They hear a sound. It’s almost like a breath, the breath of something very large.“What was that?” asks one of the helpers.The farmer turns to answer but before he can open his mouth, he’s slapped by a gust of unnatural wind. Above and all around them, the trees protest showering them with dead leaves and broken twigs. Their torch is extinguished in an instant, leaving a trail of glowing red tears swirling away towards the sky. They look there, almost expecting something to happen. Nothing does. In that darkness, the stars retake their primordial importance. The forest seems to quiet down, but they know better.Without warning another blast of wind lashes the forest. They cover their faces but keep looking up. Among the hail of leaves and twigs they can see a huge, black shape cross the starry landscape. And then another two, followed by another three. The forest boils. A half-dead tree collapses just in front of them. Trapped inside their own bodies, locked in place by an overriding survival instinct, the farmers wait for the creatures to pass, praying that none of them stops for an easy snack.But Jonas and his squad have more pressing matters to attend to. He had noticed the peasants’ torch from miles away. On a different occasion he might have avoided flying over them, but tonight he cannot afford even the slightest change in course. They must fly low and they must fly fast. In his hands, the metal scepter that he’s using to steer the dragon buzzes with magic. Tiny balanced stones of fire and water glimmer in spirals all across its length.They are getting closer now. Up ahead, not that far away, the battle is in full swing. Sometimes, green lighting flashes behind the smoke that billows from the battleground. The enemy wizards had entered the fray as soon as the sun set. No purple lightning so far, which means that their own warlocks are probably bidding their time until the air support arrives. He just hopes the infantry doesn’t get wiped out until then.He takes another puff from his fire-bag. The wave of focus and relaxation is just about perfect, but not quite there. He should have put a bit less tobacco in the mix. Eyes closed, he holds the navigator’s scepter with one firm, powerful arm, anticipating another river of cold mountain air in front of them. Jonas is one with the wind now. In his mind, he sees the great mountains shape the air across the land. He feels the dragon’s mighty push through his every vertebra as the creature’s huge wings propel them towards their destiny.Then, against all his strength, the scepter tilts to the right, followed by the dragon changing course. He can hear his men’s cries of surprise from behind him. There is somebody else’s hand on the scepter. He grabs it with his other hand even before opening his eyes in anger and surprise. There’s only room for a single pilot underneath the dragon’s scaled throat. But the one that has taken over his creature is not sitting next to Jonas, but rather floating in the air just ahead of him.Surrounded by a shimmering blue sphere is the last person he expected to see today. She looks straight into his soul, expressing wrathful patience. Her eyes beg him to keep hold of her hand, but the diamond crown on her head punishes his transgression. Jonas immediately lets go. He throws his hands to his sides, in unconditioned surrender. They’ve been discovered. The mission is over.“Majesty…” he manages to whisper, knowing that his word has been smothered by the torrents of air as soon as it left his lips.With a gracious wave of her hand, she extends her magical shield around him. Inside the holy silence, his own heartbeat terrifies him. She’s going to crash them into the ground. Or worse, she’s going to turn him against his own people.“Hello Jonas”, she says. Her voice is an avatar of innocence but it makes his hair stand as if a venomous spider were creeping into his ear. There is power beyond human understanding in her every syllable.Jonas cannot dare look behind, but he hopes that the rest of the squad has not been tricked into following the new direction. Dragons are immune to most spells, but not their pilots. What if she’s not alone? There are certain measures that can be taken against spell-casters. Jonas is well trained in them. But in front of him is no usual caster. Covered in a simple white and silver robe is the Ivory Princess herself. Her milky skin makes her appear defenseless against his seared, battle-scarred body, yet he knows she can turn him to dust in the blink of an eye.He’s too scared to think what to do next so he just sits there with his hands still at his sides, having relinquished complete control of his dragon. The woman smiles at him. He sinks inside her oceanic eyes.“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to hurt you.”The dragon continues its flight unabated. Below, the ground moves at dizzying speed and above, not a single lock of her dark hair moves. His pilot instincts scream against the violation of the rules of nature. They’re sitting in a bubble of calmness where even a stray green firefly has found refuge.With slow movements, the Princess draws a rectangle in the space between them. He watches her index finger scar the air with its sharp whiteness. She’s drawing a map. On it her hands flow leaving colored marks and ghosty lines.“That’s where the wizards are”, she says while placing more marks on the map. “And that’s where the griffons are. They’ll be expecting you to attack the wizards from the north. But they’re in for a surprise now, aren’t they?”“Wh…” he stammers. “Why are you showing me this? We… we’re fighting against you.” She smiles again. He wants to forget about the battle.“You’re not. You’re fighting my family, a family that has disrespected this land and its people.”Her words only deepen his expression of disbelief. She tilts her head a little, in an almost playful way.“It’s not only because of my family’s arrogance that the dragons have sided with you. I’ve been following you for a long time Jonas. You are a special man. No usual soldier would have stood up to the Regency. No usual soldier could have trained a squad of Dragon Knights as adept as yours.”He finds that his fear has been replaced with something entirely different, but just as incapacitating for the mind. The Princess is perhaps the most dangerous of all the ruling family, the only one that had bothered to undergo military training. And yet here she is, talking to a traitor, a man who her own parents would love nothing more than to burn at the stake. It doesn’t make sense. It must be a trick.“It’s no trick”, she replies to his thoughts. “It’s your chance to make a difference.”The blue sphere around them starts to shimmer.“I’d like you to come back alive from this mission Jonas. I’d like to meet you in person one day.”Before he can realize what’s going on, she leans over and kisses him on the lips, imparting a jolt of dizzying energy. For a second, it’s light that flows through his veins. He feels like he might faint, but then the cold night air blasts him to wakefulness. The blue sphere and the white shape within are blown away. He looks behind and sees tiny whirlwinds of sparkling dust dance into nothingness underneath his dragon’s wings. He notices the other dragons following close behind. They continue on the new course. In just half an hour, history will indeed be written.

﻿5With his fire-bag now empty, Jonas is ready for battle. His mind is storming through tactical calculations as he anticipates every possible trajectory of the first dozen enemy griffons. He pulls the citrus spray from his belt and squeezes it hard towards his companions sitting behind, upon the dragon’s spine. They have been waiting all day for this signal. On cue, they prepare their bows and incendiary bombs.To their delight, half of the griffons aren’t even manned. Their riders are nearby, but nearby is thirty seconds closer to death. Jonas grins. Even the wind is on their side today. The enemy hears the huge creatures approaching, but it is too late.Upon a thin wooden arch extending from the dragon’s throat down to the pilot’s right, a prism starts glowing in a dark, voracious red. Jonas touches it and prepares his bow executing a flawless ritual. The dragon’s head moves backwards. After one final, mighty push, they’re in range of the first griffons. With a blood-curdling growl, the dragon showers the ground with its acid venom. A single, well placed fire arrow from Jonas ignites the first two griffons. Incendiary bombs start falling. Jonas erupts in laughter. He is one with his dragon, invincible, unleashed. They’ve won.As his dragon comes back for another run, a large, triangular portion of the sky starts flickering blue and red. It’s like the side of a huge pyramid. The forest blinks out of existence, replaced by green rectangles.“What is…” he manages before a mountain shows up in front of them. They fly through it, ending up in a twisted field made up of patches of leather, bricks, starry sky, feathers, clouds and turbulent ocean. Blue and yellow stripes dance across the jumbled pattern below. They look just like the colored stripes on the visor he’s wearing. It’s like it was stretched to hundreds of miles away.His dragon gets stuck in mid-air, everything freezes. A scream from one of the enemy riders gets stuck in time becoming a horrible, screeching wail that drills into his brain. Strange runes start floating on the ground. There is no ground anymore, just a dark blue emptiness. Jonas threshes in his seat. Then, there is no seat. Everything disappears and along with it, so does his strength. He can’t move.Jonas tries to scream but there’s something stuck in his throat. Muscles cramp, his skin starts burning. Then he’s falling, or at least it feels like that. The sensation doesn’t last long. A blast of sharp and unbearable pain all over his body informs him that he hit the ground. So this how dying in a dragon crash feels like. But against all logic, it doesn’t end.Something rakes his face off. His eyes are pulled out of his head. His throat is ripped from his chest. In spite of all this, he’s still somehow in one piece. The sensations contradict themselves like in a nightmare. He can hear himself scream and sees a light so bright he wishes blindness could save him. But his eyes are fine because as the light changes direction, it illuminates the very real face of an old man dressed in a strange, black uniform. This can only mean one thing. The Princess betrayed him. He’s in enemy hands.“Whhhhh...” gargles Jonas. He feels a liquid spilling over his lips, warming his chin and neck.“Good morning sunshine”, speaks the old man. His olive skin is as alien to Jonas as the uniform he’s wearing. On his left shoulder he has a magical torch that showers him and the cave in which they seem to be in a cold, white light.“Whiizzzrddd…” he manages before a liquid cough smothers his voice. Against the merciless white light, Jonas sees droplets of bloodied saliva erupting from his own mouth. Now he wishes he really were in a dragon crash instead of being captured by a wizard. He fears the black eyes staring back at him. He fears their power and their wisdom.“What’s he saying?” asks a younger voice from somewhere behind the old man.“How should WWstrongWWIWWstrongWW know?” answers the wizard.
